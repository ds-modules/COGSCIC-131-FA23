    "One day, you find yourself standing in a musty room in the back of an old magic shop. Heavy velvet curtains cover the dirty windows, reluctantly letting in a few narrow beams of light, which succeed only in illuminating layers of dust suspended in the stale air. You glance around cautiously, trying not to invite scrutiny from the watchful shopkeep. Your eyes dance over row upon row of leather-bound books, resting on the rich mahogany shelves lining each wall. Who knows how long they've been here, or what ancient secrets they conceal. They almost call out to you to be opened, to divulge their long-forgotten knowledge. But no... you've come here for another reason.\n",
    "\n",
    " Before you can even turn around, the shopkeep anticipates your question. \"You've come for a coin, haven't you?\" His voice sounds strangely distant, and reminds you of some kind of large, creepy bird or something. You nod, swallowing. He totters past you, one of his legs struggling to keep up with the other. Reaching a black armoire in the corner of the room â€” how did you not notice it before? â€” he stops. The shopkeep slowly opens one of the drawers, revealing a beautiful, glimmering coin. It looks perfectly untarnished, yet, somehow, emanates the energy of centuries past. \n",
    "\n",
    " Your father's deep, soulful voice echoes in your head. \"Fetch me a coin of Azeroth, child, but only if its probability of landing heads is between 0.55 and 0.75.\"\n",
    " \n",
    " **To summarize:** a shopkeeper gets a coin out of an armoire in his magic shop, and shows it to you. You must determine if it meets your father's criteria: a probability of landing heads between 0.55 and 0.75.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <hr/>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Is the coin in the armoire such a coin? How can we determine if this coin matches father's request?\n",
    "\n",
    "  We can formalize your predicament by letting the variable $\\theta$ denote a coin of Azeroth's probability of landing heads on each toss, which is what you need to infer. We assume that each toss is independent of the others. In this learning problem, your hypothesis space is the set of all possible values of $\\theta$, which is all the real numbers from 0 to 1. We need to compare an infinite number of hypotheses! How can we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remaining part of the problem set, you will write functions that estimate the weight of the coin. Each function takes a single argument, a sequence of tosses, a $1 \\times n$ binary row vector representing an observed sequence of coin tosses where `1`'s represent heads and `0`'s represent tails."
